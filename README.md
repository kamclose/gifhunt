# Features

# Home Page:
The home page serves as the main landing page for GifHunt.
It features a search box where users can enter their search query.
There is a "Search" button next to the search box, which users can click to initiate the search.
Upon searching, the website will display the search results section and the trending GIFs section.

# Search Results:
After clicking the "Search" button, GifHunt will fetch results from the Giphy API based on the user's search query.
The search results section will display a grid or list of GIFs that match the search query.
Users can scroll through the search results to view more GIFs.
Clicking on a GIF can open a larger version of the GIF or redirect to a separate page with more details about the GIF.

# Trending GIFs:
GifHunt's home page will have a section displaying trending GIFs.
The trending GIFs are fetched from the Giphy API and are not related to the user's search query.
Users can view the trending GIFs by scrolling through the section.
Clicking on a trending GIF can either open a larger version of the GIF or redirect the user to a separate page with more details about the GIF.

# About Us Page:
GifHunt includes an "About Us" page where users can learn more about the website.
The "About Us" page can provide information such as the purpose of GifHunt, its mission, or any other relevant details.

# Navigation Menu:
GifHunt have a navigation menu located at the top of the page.
The navigation menu include options such as "Home," "About Us,".
Users can click on these menu options to navigate to the corresponding sections of the website.

# Ideas for future improvement
1 - I would like to add a GIF CATEGORIES section to sort some of the most popular GIFs by their common attributes. 
2 - Implement a SIGN UP / LOG IN system for tracking, promotion, and data collection. 
3 - Allow users that are logged in to save FAVORITE GIFs to their profile. 

# Sharing Functionality:
One improvement could be to enhance the sharing functionality of GifHunt. Currently, users can view GIFs, but we can add share feature to allow user to share their favorite gifs with their followers and friends. 

# User Login and Favorite GIFs:
Implementing a user login feature would provide users with the ability to create personalized accounts on GifHunt. This feature would allow users to save their favorite GIFs to their profile and easily access them at any time. With a login system, users can curate their own GIF collections, organize them into folders or categories, and have a personalized experience on the website. This feature adds a layer of personalization and encourages users to engage with the platform regularly.

# GIF Categories and Tags:
To enhance the search experience on GifHunt, we can introduce a categorization system with predefined categories and tags for GIFs. This improvement would enable users to browse GIFs based on specific categories such as emotions, reactions, animals, sports, or entertainment. Additionally, allowing users to add tags to GIFs or contribute to the categorization system through user-generated tags would enhance the searchability and discoverability of GIFs. This feature would make it easier for users to find GIFs relevant to their interests and preferences, improving the overall user experience on GifHunt.
